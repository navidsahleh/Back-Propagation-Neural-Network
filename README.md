# Back-Propagation-Neural-Network
In this Repository we implemen simple neural network with python from skratch. The dataset that we use is the Mnist, which consist of 4200 samples that has labeled on 10 features. We update our weights in each epoch by using multi layer perceptrone and Back propagation learning role.

# Packages
we use these packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot 
- sklearn
