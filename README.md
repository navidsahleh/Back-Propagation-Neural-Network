# Back-Propagation-Neural-Network
In this Repository we implement a simple neural network with python from skratch. The datasets that we use are the Mnist and iris. Mnist dataset consist of 4200 samples and iris dataset has 150 samples. We update our weights in each epoch by using multi layer perceptrone and Back propagation learning role. We also used optimizing parameters such as learning rate and momentum.

# Datasets
- iris
- Mnist


# Packages
we use these packages:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot 
- sklearn

**hint**: for Mnist dataset, you can download it from above link of kaggle :
